When I was in high school, I got a rash on my arm that I initially thought was a bug bite. 
Nothing we tried to treat it worked, and then it started to spread. 
It took two years and 10 doctors to figure out that I had lupus. 
I remember the exact moment my life as a "healthy" child completely changed; it happened right after the summer of 2011. That summer was the last time I felt normal in my skin â€” then the rashes appeared.

It was a few months into my freshman year of high school, I noticed small, red rings forming on my right arm. My family initially thought a bug had bitten me, so we tried ointments like calamine lotion to stop the itching.

When these ointments didn't work, we began to Google terms like "red rings on the skin" to figure out what was wrong with me.

Over the next few weeks, the once-small rings grew significantly and began to connect like a puzzle on my forearm. Nothing was working, and not only were these ringworm-like rashes an eyesore, they were also tender to the touch. My frustration and worry grew; my family and I had no idea how to ease my growing pain.
