The Atlas Lions are already the most successful African team in World Cup history – becoming the first ever nation to reach the final four of the tournament.

To reach the semifinal stage, Morocco has beaten European heavyweights Belgium, Spain and Portugal.

Now the Atlas Lions face the best Europe has to offer – world champion France.

After Morocco defeated Portugal, head coach Walid Regragui compared his team to “Rocky.”

“We have made our people and our continent so happy and proud. When you watch ‘Rocky,’ you want to support Rocky Balboa and I think we are the ‘Rocky’ of this World Cup,” said Regragui. “I think now the world is with Morocco.”
